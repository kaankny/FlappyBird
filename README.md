<h1>Flappy Bird Clone</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game developed using Unity. The game involves controlling a bird as it flies between columns of green pipes without hitting them.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to recreate the mechanics of the Flappy Bird game using Unity and to showcase the use of a custom editor window for configuring game settings. This project demonstrates the use of Unity for game development and how custom editor windows can enhance the development workflow.</p>

<h2>Project Contents</h2>

<h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
<p>The game involves a bird that the player controls by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make it flap its wings and rise. The goal is to navigate the bird through gaps in the columns of pipes without hitting them. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.</p>

<h3>Custom Editor Window</h3>
<p>All game settings and configurations can be adjusted using a custom editor window in Unity. This window allows for easy modification of game parameters such as the bird's speed, gravity, pipe generation rate, and more.</p>
